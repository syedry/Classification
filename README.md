 || K-Nearest Neighbors ||
 This algorithm is a classification algorithm used to predict the class of a new or unknown case based on its similarity to other cases. 
 The algorithm works by selecting a value for K, calculating the distance between the new case and each case in the dataset, finding the K nearest neighbors, 
 and predicting the response of the unknown data point based on the most popular response value from the K nearest neighbors. The choice of K is important, 
 as a low value can result in overfitting and capturing noise in the data, while a high value can lead to an overly generalized model. The similarity between 
 cases is calculated using measures such as Euclidean distance. To determine the best value for K, a part of the data is reserved for testing the accuracy of 
 the model. Nearest neighbors analysis can also be used to compute values for a continuous target.
